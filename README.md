# Narration_Project
🎯 Overview

This is a personal Java project that simulates a utopian interview scenario in which the main character is evaluated by a company in a restaurant.
The user personalizes the character by choosing personality flaws (e.g., insecurity, impulsiveness), which influence the path the story takes through multiple choice decisions.

🧠 Key Features
•	🧩 Interactive decision tree with branching paths
•	🎭 Character creation through flawed personality traits
•	💬 Text-based input/output with stylized narration
•	🧱 Object-Oriented structure using modular Java classes
•	🗃️ Git version control for all stages of development

💬 Motivation

With this project, I’m combining two things I love: literature and programming.
I want to explore storytelling through code, using narrative branching like a decision tree that mimics the complexity of human psychology.

📈 Goals
•	Build a robust, testable object-oriented structure
•	Use Git actively to strengthen terminal and version control skills
•	Experiment with slow-paced narration and narrative logic
